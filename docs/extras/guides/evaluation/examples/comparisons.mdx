# Comparing Chain Outputs

Suppose you have two different prompts (or LLMs). How do you know which will generate "better" results?

One automated way to predict the preferred configuration is to use a `PairwiseStringEvaluator` like the `PairwiseStringEvalChain`<a name="cite_ref-1"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1). This chain prompts an LLM to select which output is preferred, given a specific input.

For this evaluation, we will need 3 things:
1. An evaluator
2. A dataset of inputs
3. 2 (or more) LLMs, Chains, or Agents to compare

Then we will aggregate the restults to determine the preferred model.

1. Note: Automated evals are still an open research topic and are best used alongside other evaluation approaches.
LLM preferences exhibit biases, including banal ones like the order of outputs.
In choosing preferences, "ground truth" may not be taken into account, which may lead to scores that aren't grounded in utility._

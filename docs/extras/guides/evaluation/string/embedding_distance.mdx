# Embedding Distance

To measure semantic similarity (or dissimilarity) between a prediction and a reference label string, you could use a vector distance metric between the two embedded representations using the `embedding_distance` evaluator.


**Note:** This returns a **distance** score, meaning that the lower the number, the **more** similar the prediction is to the reference, according to their embedded representation.

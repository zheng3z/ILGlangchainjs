# ChatGoogleVertexAI

LangChain.js supports Google Vertex AI chat models as an integration.
It supports two different methods of authentication based on whether you're running
in a Node environment or a web environment.

## Setup

### Node

To call Vertex AI models in Node, you'll need to install [Google's official auth client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-auth-library) as a peer dependency.

You should make sure the Vertex AI API is
enabled for the relevant project and that you've authenticated to
Google Cloud using one of these methods:

- You are logged into an account (using `gcloud auth application-default login`)
  permitted to that project.
- You are running on a machine using a service account that is permitted
  to the project.
- You have downloaded the credentials for a service account that is permitted
  to the project and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment
  variable to the path of this file.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install google-auth-library
```

### Web

To call Vertex AI models in web environments (like Edge functions), you'll need to install
the [`web-auth-library`](https://github.com/kriasoft/web-auth-library) pacakge as a peer dependency:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install web-auth-library
```

Then, you'll need to add your service account credentials directly as a `GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_WEB_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:

```
GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_WEB_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account","project_id":"YOUR_PROJECT-12345",...}
```

You can also pass your credentials directly in code like this:

```typescript
import { ChatGoogleVertexAI } from "langchain/chat_models/googlevertexai/web";

const model = new ChatGoogleVertexAI({
  authOptions: {
    credentials: {"type":"service_account","project_id":"YOUR_PROJECT-12345",...},
  },
});
```

## Usage

Several models are available and can be specified by the `model` attribute
in the constructor. These include:

- code-bison (default)
- code-bison-32k

The ChatGoogleVertexAI class works just like other chat-based LLMs,
with a few exceptions:

1. The first `SystemMessage` passed in is mapped to the "context" parameter that the PaLM model expects.
   No other `SystemMessages` are allowed.
2. After the first `SystemMessage`, there must be an odd number of messages, representing a conversation between a human and the model.
3. Human messages must alternate with AI messages.

There is also an optional `examples` constructor parameter that can help the model understand what an appropriate response
looks like.

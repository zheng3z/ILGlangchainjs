# PGVector

To enable vector search in a generic PostgreSQL database, LangChain.js supports using the [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) Postgres extension.

## Setup

To work with PGVector, you need to install the `pg` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install pg
```

### Setup a `pgvector` self hosted instance with `docker-compose`

`pgvector` provides a prebuilt Docker image that can be used to quickly setup a self-hosted Postgres instance.
Create a file below named `docker-compose.yml`:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import DockerExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/pgvector_vectorstore/docker-compose.example.yml";

<CodeBlock language="yml" name="docker-compose.yml">
  {DockerExample}
</CodeBlock>

And then in the same directory, run `docker compose up` to start the container.

You can find more information on how to setup `pgvector` in the [official repository](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).

## Usage

import Example from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/pgvector_vectorstore/pgvector.ts";

One complete example of using `PGVectorStore` is the following:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

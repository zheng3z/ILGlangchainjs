# XML Agent

Some language models (like Anthropic's Claude) are particularly good at reasoning/writing XML.
The below example shows how to use an agent that uses XML when prompting.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import XMLExample from "@examples/agents/xml.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{XMLExample}</CodeBlock>

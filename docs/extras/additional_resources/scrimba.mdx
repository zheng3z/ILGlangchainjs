# Scrimba interactive guides

[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) is a code-learning platform that allows you to interactively edit and run
code while watching a video walkthrough.

We've partnered with Scrimba on course materials (called "scrims") that teach the fundamentals of building with LangChain.js - 
check them out below, and check back for more as they become available!
